<strong>TOWELDAY PETITION PAGE</strong>

<p>Towelday Petition Page was my first full stack project at <a href="https://www.spiced-academy.com/en/program/full-stack-web-development/?gclid=CjwKCAjw4MP5BRBtEiwASfwALxpOPOTnCn-ZlPACzpYwRih4SSzYRfxkCuOBJcq71BpkHsr1naRbwRoCStYQAvD_BwE">SPICED Academy</a> Berlin.
The project requirement was to create an online petition that visitors can sign to make their voice heard on an issue of our choosing.</p>
